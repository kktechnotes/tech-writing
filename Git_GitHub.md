# Git and Git Hub for Writers
This article lists down keypoints on the version control system Git and hosting platform GitHub. I have listed these points after going through the course on [Udemy](https://udemy.com) by **Peter Grenbaum**.
## Overview
Git was developed by **Linus Torvalds**. This is highly used for *Docs as a Code* concept -- documenting the same way the code is written and reviewed.
Git is also used as version control system and is highly used for collaboration. Rather than storing every version, Git stores the differences in the version.
**Git** is a version control system and **GitHub** is the platform that hosts Git files.
